# Ampere

![Amperemeter](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Amperemeter_hg.jpg/200px-Amperemeter_hg.jpg)

Basically, View-agnostic fork of [re-frame][1] plus subscriptions replaced with [Javelin][3] formulas.
And integrated [VFSM][4] for drawing state machines of handlers logic as a bonus.

## Why?

Because sometimes I need to use [Om][2] in projects, but its cursors acts like MegaOhm resistors in architecture. We need more electric current to light up the bulb!
And... if Om, why not any another View library? You can use Ampere with Om, Hoplon, Reagent — or write adapter for your favorite lib, it is easy to do.
