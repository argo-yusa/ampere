# Ampere

Basically, port of [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) to [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om) & [Javelin](https://github.com/tailrecursion/javelin). The main difference (besides rendering by Om) is using Javelin formul√¶ instead of subscriptions.
And integrated [VFSM](https://github.com/ul/vfsm) as a bonus.

## Why?

Because sometimes I need to use Om in projects, but its cursors acts like MegaOhm resistors in architecture. We need more electric current to light up the bulb!
